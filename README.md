# DSA Assignment FIXME

Accepting the GitHub Assignment will create a repo with a series of challenges at `/src/main/java/tech.strategio` and its corresponding unit tests at `/src/test/java/tech.strategio`.

Each exercise contains a class with a method. Complete the methods in an IDE such that the unit tests pass. You should run your unit tests often, either through your Java IDE or through the command line (`gradle test`).

To submit the exercises, push a commit to GitHub. Automated tests will run, and youâ€™ll see a green checkbox if ALL unit tests pass.
